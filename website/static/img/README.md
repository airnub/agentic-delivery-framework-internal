# Image Assets (Informative)

The public docs site ships with SVG placeholders so that all assets remain text-based. If you need to restore the branded favicon bundle, place the binary file at `website/static/img/favicon.ico` before running a private build. Keep the asset private if it contains licensed artwork.
