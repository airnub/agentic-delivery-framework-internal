# Start Here (Informative)

The Agentic Delivery Framework (ADF) keeps **Scrum as the baseline** while adding agent-aware safety rails. It combines:

- **Change Request (CR)-First flow** so every Increment is governed by a single merge request.
- **Sequential Subtask Pipeline (SSP)** to serialize human/agent contributions on one Story branch.
- **Delivery Pulse**: a â‰¤10 minute daily checkpoint that inspects merged work and quality gates.

ADF is aimed at product teams adopting human+AI delivery. Keep Scrum roles, events, and artifacts; layer ADF evidence and guardrails on top. Normative rules live in the [ADF Specification v0.5.0](../specs/adf-spec-v0.5.0.md) and [Handbook](../handbook/ssp.md).

## How to Use This Site

1. **Map to Scrum**: Review the [Agile/Scrum alignment](agile-scrum-map.md) to see that no new ceremonies are required.
2. **Adopt in Levels**: Pick your [conformance level](adoption-guide.md) and follow the [L1 Quickstart](quickstart-l1.md).
3. **Apply the Normative Rules**: Reference the [Specification](../specs/adf-spec-v0.5.0.md) for MUST/SHOULD requirements and the [Handbook](../handbook/ssp.md) for operating detail.
4. **Use Templates and Profiles**: Start with the [PR template](../templates/pr-template.md) and the [GitHub profile](../profiles/github.md) to implement CR gates.

For deeper study, continue into the normative `/docs/specs` and `/docs/handbook` sections.
