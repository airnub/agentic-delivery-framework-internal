# L1 Quickstart (Informative)

Adopt ADF foundations in a single day. Pair this playbook with the [Adoption Guide](adoption-guide.md) and formal rules in the [Specification](../specs/adf-spec-v0.5.0.md).

## Morning — Prepare the Workspace
- Add the [PR template](../templates/pr-template.md) and Story Preview checklist to your repository.
- Enable `tests-ci` and `spec-verify` required checks (minimum CR gates for L1).
- Align the team on SSP basics: one Story branch, serialized subtasks, exclusive lease.

## Midday — Run the First Story
- Create a Story branch with SSP subtasks sequenced in your issue tracker.
- Execute each subtask, capturing Story Preview updates and gate evidence in the CR.
- Use the [Handbook SSP chapter](../handbook/ssp.md) as the operating manual.

## Afternoon — Delivery Pulse + Acceptance
- Host the first Delivery Pulse (≤10 minutes). Review the Pulse Increment, open CRs, and gate status.
- Product Owner reviews Story Preview, confirms acceptance, and merges when gates are green.
- Archive the Evidence Bundle (`requirements-trace.json`) with links to gate outputs.

## Evening — Retrospect and Schedule Next Pulse
- Capture feedback: Does SSP feel smooth? Are gates visible? Any automation gaps?
- Schedule the next Delivery Pulse and confirm backlog is ready for the next Sprint day.
- Update your conformance checklist for L1 completion and plan the L2 hardening items.

From here, continue through L2 and L3 in the [Adoption Guide](adoption-guide.md).
