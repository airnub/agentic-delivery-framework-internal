# ADF Audits

- This folder contains **dated, immutable** audit documents of the ADF repo.
- Naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-adf-audit.md`
- Source: created manually and via the weekly GitHub Action (see `.github/workflows/adf-weekly-audit.yml`).
- Scope: audits are **informative**; the normative method remains in `docs/specs`.
- Weekly runs rely on `.github/prompts/adf-weekly-audit.prompt.yaml` and the scheduled workflow under `.github/workflows/`.
