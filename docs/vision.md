# Vision

Build a **safe, GitHubâ€‘native Agentic Delivery Framework (ADF)** that:
- Treats **ADF Iterations** (Sprint/Cycle) as the primary unit of planning and execution.
- Runs **all code changes inside Codespaces**, never on developer laptops.
- Uses **PR-first governance** with automated and human review.
- Stays **model-agnostic** by calling **GitHub Models** (OpenAI/Anthropic/Google).
- Scales from solo repos to multi-team programs while remaining auditable.

The end state: a repeatable two-loop system where product intent (Epics/Stories) flows into a fresh, prebuilt Codespace, the Delivery Team ships increments under strong gates, and the Program Director plans the next Iteration from observed outcomes. The enterprise-friendly ADF naming keeps directors, PMO, and engineering aligned without methodology lock-in.
