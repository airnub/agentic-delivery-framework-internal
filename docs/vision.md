# Vision

Build a **safe, GitHub‑native agentic development framework** that:
- Treats **Agile sprints** as the primary unit of planning and execution.
- Runs **all code changes inside Codespaces**, never on developer laptops.
- Uses **PR‑first governance** with automated and human review.
- Stays **model‑agnostic** by calling **GitHub Models** (OpenAI/Anthropic/Google).
- Scales from solo repos to multi‑team programs while remaining auditable.

The end state: a repeatable two‑loop system where product intent (stories) flows into a fresh, prebuilt Codespace, inner agents ship shippable increments under strong gates, and the outer orchestrator plans the next sprint from observed outcomes.
