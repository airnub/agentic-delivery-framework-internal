# Request for Comments (RFC) Process

The RFC process captures proposals that materially change the Agentic Delivery Framework specification, conformance levels, or platform profiles.

## When to Write an RFC

- Introducing or modifying normative requirements in the specification or CONFORMANCE.md.
- Adding a new platform profile or altering an existing profile’s terminology or workflow.
- Establishing governance changes, release cadence adjustments, or major roadmap shifts.

Minor clarifications, typo fixes, or non-normative examples typically do **not** require an RFC. Editors may still request one if consensus is unclear.

## Workflow

1. **Draft** — Copy [0000-template.md](0000-template.md) to `docs/RFCs/NNNN-short-title.md`, replacing `NNNN` with the next available number.
2. **Discuss** — Open a change request including the RFC. Invite feedback from Program Director and Delivery Team stewards.
3. **Decide** — Editors record the outcome (Accepted/Rejected/Deferred) in the RFC header and merge the change request with supporting documentation.
4. **Implement** — Follow up with specification updates, profile mappings, or ADRs as required by the RFC.

## Index

- 0000-template.md — Use this template for new proposals.
- Accepted/Rejected RFCs remain in this directory for historical context.
