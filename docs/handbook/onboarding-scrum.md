# Onboarding for Scrum teams

ADF preserves product goals and empiricism while Delivery Pulse replaces the daily scrum when asynchronous agents contribute.

| Scrum concept | ADF lens | What changes |
|---|---|---|
| Daily Scrum | Delivery Pulse | Async agents produce a Pulse Increment; humans do a 10â€“15 min inspect-and-adapt on the increment. |
| Sprint Goal | Product Goal | Same intent; ADF recommends Story Previews to align agent work. |
| Definition of Done | DoD + CR Gates | Merge only when required gates are green. |
| Developers | Human/AI/Hybrid | Same accountability; agents run in governed workspaces. |

Cross-train the team on [Story Preview](story-preview.md), [CR Gates](cr-gates.md), and [Metrics](metrics.md) so Scrum cadences stay evidence-driven.
