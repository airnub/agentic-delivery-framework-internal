# Onboarding for Kanban teams

- **WIP control:** SSPâ€™s Story Lease enforces single-item WIP at the story level; subtasks are sequenced, not parallelized.
- **Flow metrics:** Use existing [Metrics](metrics.md) for lead time, SSP stall rate, rework rate, and escape defects.
- **Policies, not ceremonies:** Keep your board; ADF constrains how work flows ([CR-first](../specs/adf-spec-v0.5.0.md#1-core-rules--cr-first-and-evidence), gates, SSP), not your columns. See the [SSP guide](ssp.md) for sequencing patterns.
