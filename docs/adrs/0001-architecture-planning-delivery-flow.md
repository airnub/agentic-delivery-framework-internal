# ADR 0001: Planning & Delivery Flow (Delivery Lead + Developers)

- Status: Accepted (updated terminology in spec v0.3.0)
- Earlier vocabulary is preserved in archived documents; current work uses the Delivery Lead, Product Owner, and Developers terminology throughout.

## Context

Repository renamed from `airnub/agentic-agile` to `airnub/agentic-delivery-framework` to emphasize a vendor-neutral methodology. We still need safe, auditable agentic development that maps onto Sprints, keeps execution inside governed workspace runtimes, and aligns with enterprise governance.

## Decision

Adopt a **planning & delivery flow** architecture anchored by Delivery Lead, Product Owner, and Developers:

- **Delivery Lead** operates outside the workspace runtime, steers Sprint events (Planning, Delivery Pulse, Review, Retro), manages workspace runtime lifecycle, and enforces CR-first governance including Performance Budget checks when applicable.
- **Product Owner** maintains the Product Goal and Product Backlog, collaborates on Story Previews, and accepts outcomes during Sprint Review.
- **Developers** work inside the workspace runtime to implement Stories via Change Requests. They produce Story Previews before a Story is marked Done and contribute to the daily Pulse Increment.
- **Change Request Gates** provide layered assurance: CI/tests, QA verification, security review, automated review, required human approvals, and Performance Budget verification before merge.

## Diagrams
- Historical diagrams: [Mermaid overview flow (GitHub-centric)](../diagrams/adf-overview-flow.mmd), [Mermaid sequence (GitHub-centric)](../diagrams/adf-sequence.mmd).
- Neutral diagrams (preferred): [Mermaid overview flow](../diagrams/adf-overview-neutral.mmd), [Mermaid planning & delivery sequence](../diagrams/adf-sequence-neutral.mmd).

  participant DL as Delivery Lead (outside runtime)
  participant PO as Product Owner

  participant WR as Workspace Runtime
  participant DEV as Developers (workspace)
  participant CRG as Change Request Gates

  DL->>WM: Facilitate Sprint Planning & set Sprint Goal

  DL->>WR: Create/Resume Workspace Runtime (warm starts, secrets)
  DL->>DEV: Brief Developers; confirm WIP limits & DoD
  DEV->>WR: git switch -c feat/&lt;story&gt;
  DEV->>CRG: Open Change Request ("Closes &lt;story&gt;") with Story Preview
  CRG->>CRG: CI/Tests | QA | Security | Automated | Human | Performance Budget
  alt All gates pass
    CRG->>WR: Merge to protected branch (Increment meets DoD)
    DL->>WM: Update Sprint board & telemetry
  else Any gate fails
    CRG->>DEV: Feedback & failing checks
    DEV->>WR: Iterate fixes on branch
  end
  DL->>DEV: Delivery Pulse — review Pulse Increment & next actions
  DL->>WM: Sprint Review & plan next Sprint
```

## Alternatives Considered

- **Managed cloud agents** (single-vendor IDEs or hosted sandboxes): faster to start, but limited environment control, portability, and governance alignment.
- **Local developer machines**: unsafe and non-reproducible for autonomous edits.
- **Single big agent run (waterfall)**: poor feedback loops; hard to govern or apply WIP limits.

## Consequences

- **Pros**: safety (no unmanaged edits), transparent Story Previews and Pulse Increments, governance through change request gates, model choice via open APIs, reproducible environments, enterprise naming alignment.
- **Cons**: orchestration costs (workspace runtime minutes, warm starts, secrets). Mitigate with idle shutdowns, budgets, telemetry, and Delivery Pulse inspections per [Conformance L3](../conformance.md).
