# Scrum Purity Scorecard

Use this checklist to confirm Scrum fundamentals stay intact while layering ADF safety rails. Score one point for each "Yes" response.

| # | Check | Status (Yes/No) | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Product Owner maintains a single Product Backlog ordered toward the Product Goal | [ ] | |
| 2 | Sprint Goal is declared at Sprint Planning and referenced during Daily Pulse adaptation | [ ] | |
| 3 | Sprint Backlog is the sole plan of record (no parallel boards or hidden work queues) | [ ] | |
| 4 | Daily Pulse (â‰¤10 minutes) serves as the Daily Scrum inspect/adapt moment | [ ] | |
| 5 | Integrated Increment is demonstrated to stakeholders every Sprint Review | [ ] | |
| 6 | Sprint Retrospective happens each Sprint with explicit improvement actions | [ ] | |
| 7 | Definition of Done is published, enforced, and includes Story Preview evidence | [ ] | |
| 8 | Change Requests remain the only merge path (CR-first, single Story branch per Story) | [ ] | |
| 9 | SSP is enforced (lease, queue, checkpoint, single CR) on all Stories | [ ] | |
| 10 | CR gates stay intact (`spec-verify`, `tests-ci`, `security-static`, `deps-supply-chain`, `perf-budget`, `framework-guard`, `mode-policy`, `preview-build`, `human-approval`) | [ ] | |
