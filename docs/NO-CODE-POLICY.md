# No-Code Policy

The Agentic Delivery Framework (ADF) repository hosts the methodology and specification only. To protect the neutrality and legal posture of the project:

- **No executable code** (source files, scripts, binaries, workflows that run code) may be committed to this repository.
- **Documentation artifacts only** (Markdown, diagrams, models) are permitted.
- **Reference implementations** live in dedicated repositories such as [adf-github-suite](https://github.com/airnub/adf-github-suite) and are licensed separately (e.g., MIT or Apache-2.0).
- Pull requests introducing executable content will be closed and redirected to the appropriate implementation repository.

For questions about the policy or to propose safeguards, open a discussion or RFC.
