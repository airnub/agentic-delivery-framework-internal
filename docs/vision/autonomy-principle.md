# ADF Guiding Principle: Autonomy-with-Accountability

**North Star.** ADF aims for 24×7 autonomous delivery where agents can plan, build, test, and re-plan the Product Backlog continuously—with humans shifting from “doers” to **governors** of goals, policy, and exceptions.

**How we get there.**
- **Policy-as-Code Gates:** Every agent action is funneled through CRs and measurable gates (spec, tests, security, supply chain, performance, framework/mode policy, preview, approvals).
- **Progressive Trust:** Teams opt into **Autonomy Levels (A0–A4)** that expand agent permissions only when evidence shows safety.
- **Inspectability:** Story Previews, Evidence Bundles, telemetry, and Pulse reports make work legible to humans and machines.
- **Reversibility:** Changes are small, reviewable, and can be rolled back; feature flags and migration plans are mandatory for risky updates.
- **Budgets:** Cost and risk budgets bound autonomy economically and operationally.
- **Human Governance:** Delivery Pulse and Retros keep humans in the loop for priorities, exceptions, and policy evolution.

This principle is non-normative; see the ADF specification for requirements.
