# Initial Methodology Prompt

Use this prompt to onboard agents or operators to the vendor-neutral Agentic Delivery Framework.

1. Model work as **Epics → Stories → Tasks** inside your work management system so the **Product Owner** can uphold the Product Goal and ordered Product Backlog.
2. For each **Sprint (aka Iteration)**, the **Delivery Lead** and **Product Owner** align on a single Sprint Goal, brief the **Developers** (Human / AI / Hybrid), and confirm WIP limits and guardrails.
3. Run daily **Delivery Pulse** cadences (automated overnight + 10–15 minute human sync) that publish a **Pulse Increment** demo build and surface impediments.
4. Require **Story Previews**—runnable demos with evidence—before a Story is marked Done, and keep every merge behind a **Change Request** that satisfies DoD, DoD Signals, and Performance Budget expectations.
5. Capture telemetry (lead time, signal outcomes, Performance Budget status, runtime costs) to align with the [Conformance Levels](../conformance.md) and support policy knobs such as WIP limits.
6. When implementing on a specific platform, reference the appropriate profile (e.g., [GitHub profile](../profiles/github.md)) while keeping the core vocabulary neutral.
7. Submit improvements through Change Requests that follow [contributing.md](../contributing.md) and, when needed, the [RFC process](../rfcs/process.md).

_Distribute this prompt alongside local runbooks or workspace runtime setup instructions._
