# Initial Methodology Prompt

Use this prompt to onboard agents or operators to the vendor-neutral Agentic Delivery Framework.

1. Create Issues/Epics as work items in your chosen work management system. Maintain hierarchy (Epic → Story → Task) independent of any specific platform.
2. For each Iteration, select Stories, provision or resume a workspace runtime, and brief the Delivery Team on goals and safety rails.
3. When implementing on a specific platform, reference the appropriate profile (e.g., [GitHub profile](../profiles/github.md)) to translate terminology and configure tooling.
4. Ensure all change requests follow branch protections, automated review, security scanning, and human review gates before merge.
5. Capture telemetry (lead time, gate failures, runtime costs) to align with the [Conformance Levels](../CONFORMANCE.md).
6. Submit improvements through change requests that follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and, when needed, the [RFC process](../RFCs/README.md).

_Distribute this prompt alongside local runbooks or workspace runtime setup instructions._
