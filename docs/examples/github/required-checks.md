_Informative._ Use `docs/examples/github/required-checks.list` to seed the `tests-ci`, `security-static`, `deps-supply-chain`, `framework-guard`, and other mandated status checks in GitHub. Apply these checks to the default branch protection so every Change Request honors the gate requirements.

**Key references**
- `docs/examples/github/required-checks.list` — newline-delimited list of required status checks.
- `docs/profiles/github.md` — normative mapping of CR gates to GitHub configuration.
