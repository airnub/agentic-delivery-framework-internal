_Informative._ Use `docs/examples/github/labels.csv` as the canonical sample label export for the GitHub profile. Import the CSV into your repository to provision the required gates, Story Preview, and governance labels without editing column order.

**Key references**
- `docs/examples/github/labels.csv` — importable GitHub label export with severity, gate, and workflow mappings.
- `docs/templates/labels.md` — normative description of label expectations.
