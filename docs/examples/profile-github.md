# GitHub Profile Routing Samples (Informative)

Open the repository folder [`examples/profile-github/`](https://github.com/airnub/agentic-delivery-framework-internal/tree/work/examples/profile-github) to inspect capability-class routing samples that accompany the methodology.

## Included Files
- `models.yaml` — environment-declared models and their capability claims.
- `routing.yaml` — phase → capability routing preferences with trait constraints.
- `README.md` — guidance on how to adapt these artifacts within repository-local `.adf/` directories.

> The samples are illustrative. Implementations SHOULD adapt the contents for their environment and keep repository-local routing artifacts outside the methodology repo when deploying.
