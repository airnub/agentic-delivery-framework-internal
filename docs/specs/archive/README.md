# Archived specifications

The `github/` directory contains historical GitHub-specific implementations of early Agentic Delivery Framework specs. Each file includes a prominent notice pointing to the vendor-neutral specification (`spec.v0.4.0.md`) and the GitHub platform profile.

These documents were relocated from `docs/specs/` to keep the primary specs vendor-neutral while preserving repository history.
