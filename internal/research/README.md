# Internal Research Archive

This directory consolidates research artifacts that MUST remain private to the internal repository. Keep the following controls in place:

- **Scope:** Use this space for exploratory notes, benchmarking data, and draft analyses that inform the Agentic Delivery Framework but are not yet suitable for public release.
- **Redaction:** Before any derivative work is published, you MUST review and redact confidential references. Only sanitized conclusions MAY move into `docs/` or other exportable folders.
- **Labeling:** Each document SHOULD begin with a confidentiality banner and an owner contact.
- **Formats:** Prefer Markdown or plain text for longevity. Binary files MAY be stored when necessary; include decoding guidance in an adjacent README entry.
- **Retention:** Archive superseded documents in dated subfolders so reviewers can trace the decision history during audits.

The `.oss.publish.yml` policy explicitly excludes `internal/` paths from mirroring into the public repository, so materials stored here will not be exported downstream.
