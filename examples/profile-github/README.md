# GitHub Profile Examples

This folder provides **illustrative** artifacts for routing by capability class:

- `models.yaml` — environment-declared models and the capability classes they satisfy.
- `routing.yaml` — ADF phase → capability class mapping, with preferred models and constraints.

> These are examples for methodology readers. Production systems SHOULD keep these under a repo-local `.adf/` directory in the implementing codebase (e.g., a delivery repo) so teams can change models without modifying the methodology.
