# Agentic Delivery Framework (ADF) Trademark Guidelines

The names **“Agentic Delivery Framework”**, **“ADF”**, and any associated logos are trademarks of Airnub. These guidelines describe how to reference the marks when discussing or implementing the methodology.

## Acceptable Use

- Use the names to factually reference the methodology, specification, or conformance program.
- Use statements such as “compatible with the Agentic Delivery Framework” or “implements the ADF methodology” only if your materials accurately follow the published specification and conformance levels.
- You may create descriptive logos or wordmarks for your implementation provided they are visually distinct from any official ADF branding and include your organization’s name or product identifier.

## Prohibited Use

- Do not imply endorsement, sponsorship, or partnership by Airnub or the ADF maintainers without written permission.
- Do not alter, stylize, or combine the marks with your own trademarks in a way that causes confusion about ownership or origin.
- Do not use the marks in domain names, social media handles, or package names that could mislead users into believing your project is the official ADF specification or Delivery Lead service.

## Quality and Compliance

- References to ADF must remain consistent with the vendor-neutral methodology and the published conformance requirements.
- If you distribute documentation or marketing materials mentioning ADF, include links to the official repository so readers can review the canonical methodology.
- Implementations that claim compatibility should publish conformance evidence or link to relevant RFCs/ADRs demonstrating alignment with the latest specification release.

## Fair Use and Commentary

- Fair use, academic citation, and comparative analysis are allowed provided they do not misrepresent affiliation or endorsement.
- Screenshots or excerpts of the methodology may be used under the Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 license as long as attribution requirements are met.

## Revocation

Airnub reserves the right to revoke or limit use of the marks if usage violates these guidelines, misleads the community, or harms the quality and safety expectations of the Agentic Delivery Framework. Continued use after a written revocation notice may result in legal action.
