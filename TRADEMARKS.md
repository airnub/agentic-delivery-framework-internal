- Any official logos, wordmarks, or visual assets published by Airnub for this methodology.

## Acceptable Use
- Use the marks to refer to the methodology/specification in descriptive, non-misleading ways.
- You may state compatibility or adoption as long as it is factual and does not imply Airnub endorsement or sponsorship.
- Derivative works of the spec must include attribution and share under CC BY-SA 4.0 and should retain references to the marks only when accurately describing provenance.

## Quality and Integrity

- Airnub reserves the right to request updates or revocation of mark usage if quality standards are not met.

## Prohibited Uses
- Do not register domain names, company names, or product names that are confusingly similar to the marks without explicit permission.
- Do not alter, stylize, or combine the marks with other branding in a way that suggests affiliation beyond factual references.
- Do not use the marks in contexts that violate law, promote discrimination, or compromise safety/security.

## Logos

- Logos may not be used as part of your own logo or identity without written approval.

## Revocation and Updates
- Airnub may revoke permission to use the marks at any time if these guidelines are violated or if the usage conflicts with brand or governance policies.
